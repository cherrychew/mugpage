                <p>Kero-Chan mug is one of my favorites as it not only references
                    one of my favorite anime series, but was gifted to me by a special person.</p>

                <p>There are many "black cat" mugs on the market, but this one stands out.
                    Not only are the eyes big, but there is a matching witch hat to fit around the ears.</p>

                <p>Even though this mug is impractical to use as it would be difficult to clean,
                    it makes for a wonderful pen holder year round.</p>

                <p>Unfortunately, the lip of this mug makes it inconvenient to sip from.
                    Fortunately, it makes very cute decor! If that's what you're into.</p>
